# Overview

This documentation describes KLIX checkout solution integration. Multiple integration scenarios are covered:

* Simple merchant home page that does not have an in-built shopping cart functionality. Klix Widget can be predefined to allow to buy specific product. Klix Widget HTML code should be placed in product page. No additional technical integration actions needs to be performed by merchant if orders are managed in Klix. 
* Custom built or standard ecommerce platform web shop. In this case besides placing Klix Widget HTML code on merchant check-out page bidirectional API integration should be implemented.
